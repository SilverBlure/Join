            <p>Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban
                project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what
                Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>
            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <p>Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built
                by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development
                bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term meaning
                "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages
                the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects
                in an intuitive, visual interface. It is important to note that Join
                is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
                extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible
                user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability,
                accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.</p>

                        you'll find a default board. This board represents
                        your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
                        "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".

                        you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                        projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on
                        "New contact", and fill in the required information.
                        Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and
                        they can interact with the tasks on the board.

                        <h2 class="tableHeader">Adding Cards</h2> Now that you've added your contacts,
                        you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                        tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list
                        to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card,
                        like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

                    <td>
                        <h2 class="tableHeader">Moving Cards</h2> As the task moves from one stage to another,
                        you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping
                        the card from one list to another.

                    <td>
                        <h2 class="tableHeader">Deleting Cards</h2> Once a task is completed, you can either
                        move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
                        will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise
                        caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
                        Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent
                        updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects
                        the current state of your project. Have more questions
